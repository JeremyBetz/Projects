708863442527129600,2016-03-13 03:53:09,Dead wrong. Because DC represents the establishment most Rs hate.
708861993130835969,2016-03-13 03:47:23,. includes the automatic delegate votes.
708859852035067904,2016-03-13 03:38:53,", It's the guy who sells pillows on TV."

708121165756235776,2016-03-11 02:43:36,The best aspect of this debate is that it is starving SNL and all late-night comedians for material. For once!
708116411030376448,2016-03-11 02:24:43,I don't think Vice President Christie would appreciate that.
708115758736404480,2016-03-11 02:22:07,So far it's a very substantive debate with no personal attacks. Is it too much to hope this continues?
708114874484846592,2016-03-11 02:18:36,Trump confirms that Ben Carson is endorsing him. Significant 'get' for Trump. No way was Carson endorsing Cruz.
