817875709305700354,2017-01-07 23:28:59,loved it
817875624811462656,2017-01-07 23:28:39,"oh that’s the one i forgot. really liked it, mainly because of the performances by bridges, pine, and birmingham"
817874785350909952,2017-01-07 23:25:18,i will now change my opinions
817874242150821888,2017-01-07 23:23:09,i’m still laughing at the idea that a huge casting director went to a shitty one-woman play
817873670840483843,2017-01-07 23:20:53,i’ve reached the “starting to get mad at it” phase
817873260968837120,2017-01-07 23:19:15,i may watch ‘busan’ later tonight. i’ve heard it’s fantastic

817871756606181376,2017-01-07 23:13:16,saw in the theater and on demand
817871251846926337,2017-01-07 23:11:16,“denial” wasn’t very good but it was fun seeing moriarty and mycroft together again
817871122339430400,2017-01-07 23:10:45,"“patriots day” was solid, but i liked “deepwater horizon” more, mainly because of john malkovich’s over the top performance"
817871020711415808,2017-01-07 23:10:21,the acting in “fences” was great (duh) but the movie itself was disappointing. denzel’s direction failed to turn a play into a movie
817870728586530818,2017-01-07 23:09:11,i liked “silence” but i think it would’ve been better if andrew garfield and adam driver had switched roles
817870381377875968,2017-01-07 23:07:48,“hidden figures” may not have been the “best” movie i saw but it was easily the most enjoyable
817870155950788608,2017-01-07 23:06:55,“la la land” is this year’s “birdman” for me: the more i think about it the less i like it
817870015936532482,2017-01-07 23:06:21,“moonlight” and “manchester by the sea” are as good as advertised
817869873422495746,2017-01-07 23:05:47,watching the raiders without derek carr is depressing so here are some thoughts on the movies i saw over christmas week

759595201035898884,2016-07-31 03:43:03,i said the whole statement was garbage

738206684288589824,2016-06-02 03:12:43,the highest artistic achievement of that film was using ‘race’ to mean two different things
