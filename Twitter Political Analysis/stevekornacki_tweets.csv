765582393851936772,2016-08-16 16:14:01,I'm heading over to do election handicapping guru 's podcast. Excited to be invited! Here's his map:
765527780691963904,2016-08-16 12:37:00,"Why is Clinton way ahead in Virginia? DC suburbs, : Obama % Romney % DC suburbs, now: Clinton % Trump %"
765509448760569856,2016-08-16 11:24:09,: WaPo poll of Virginia: Clinton leads Trump by a -point margin — percent to percent
765290664661835776,2016-08-15 20:54:47,Sitting in for in minutes
764635911397269504,2016-08-14 01:33:02,This kind of blows my mind
764568830773526528,2016-08-13 21:06:28,From the fantasy world where there was no media scrutiny of Trump. Reality:
764540840882548736,2016-08-13 19:15:15,Radical notion: Critical/outraged media coverage of Trump is a major reason his supporters rallied around him
764539825634488320,2016-08-13 19:11:13,"Yeah, except..."
764537073978093570,2016-08-13 19:00:17,Funny how that works
764533281727451136,2016-08-13 18:45:13,"It's almost as if most voters are capable of listening, considering and making decisions without heavyhanded lectures from media figures"
764533037958778880,2016-08-13 18:44:15,"Amazingly, despite this supposed media gutlessness, the majority of voters nonethless view Trump the way you do..."
764531014701977600,2016-08-13 18:36:12,Yep. Mondale in '84 too!
764529990801076224,2016-08-13 18:32:08,the question was why is he losing to HRC in polls with bigger crowds. We have seen that dynamic before.
764529542031552512,2016-08-13 18:30:21,well i appreciate that - thanks!
764528849698775040,2016-08-13 18:27:36,I've been saying it for a long time
764528675194826752,2016-08-13 18:26:55,Same reason Ron Paul got bigger crowds than anyone while losing every primary in '12
764528298185502720,2016-08-13 18:25:25,Btw this is the essay that set me off on all of that...
764527563486003201,2016-08-13 18:22:30,How's that working out?
764527431143133185,2016-08-13 18:21:58,Because they like him a lot. They just aren't anywhere near a majority at this point.
764526553451470848,2016-08-13 18:18:29,"People who hate Trump say:""He got all that airtime to just talk!!"" They don't realize that what people heard turned most of them against him"
764525149638922241,2016-08-13 18:12:54,And right now -- with record-high negatives and brutal poll numbers -- Trump is validating every other pol's reluctance to behave this way.
764524892523929601,2016-08-13 18:11:53,The reason no one has gotten coverage like this before is that no one thought it made sense to say/do what's required to get this attention.
764524394458656768,2016-08-13 18:09:54,So yes: Trump has gotten more free coverage than anyone ever. But THAT'S HIS STRATEGY - and it's proving so far to be a bad one.
764523912998760452,2016-08-13 18:07:59,*entire electorate
764523568851845121,2016-08-13 18:06:37,"...all of the evidence to date suggests the audience for unvarnished Trumpism is a plurality in one party, not nearly a national majority"
764523304946311169,2016-08-13 18:05:34,"That's a reality Trump has eed: There's a market for his style, and lectures from the media won't change that, for lots of reasons. But."
764523015157665793,2016-08-13 18:04:25,"...and if major outlets had followed this writer's prescription, I strongly suspect Trump's backers wouldn't back off -- they'd dig in more"
764522636911063040,2016-08-13 18:02:55,...I doubt Trump's hardcore supporters - who cheer wildly when he heaps scorn on the media - are with him b/c the media encouraged them...
764521986319982592,2016-08-13 18:00:20,...and a significantly larger chunk of the entire election turning aginst him -- in number we have *never* seen before...
764521831025881088,2016-08-13 17:59:43,"Here's the reality: All of Trump's ""free"" mainstream media resulted in about /2 of one party flocking to him..."
764485625055698944,2016-08-13 15:35:51,I don't have an exact number but Clinton's leads were consistently double-digits until the home stretch
764446461446815744,2016-08-13 13:00:13,really appreciate that. I think he was an endlessly fascinating man. And it was such a bummer to the th grade me when he lost!
764264378686251009,2016-08-13 00:56:41,Tune in at to see what comes next
764208451358711808,2016-08-12 21:14:27,Yep - first debate slashed the deficit

763937514222592000,2016-08-12 03:17:51,nope. It was started under Bush but final passage and signing was under Clinton
763922393144303645,2016-08-12 02:17:46,
763902634516287488,2016-08-12 00:59:15,"Sitting in for , fun starts in seconds. , ..."

763820671742930944,2016-08-11 19:33:33,thanks! That race spoiled me - none have ever quite measured up...
763781287677132800,2016-08-11 16:57:04,"for Sec of State as a Republican, yep!"
763757910098845696,2016-08-11 15:24:10,You inspired me to find that old post about the GOP victory models in MA and repost it:
763749148877320192,2016-08-11 14:49:21,"oh wow, small world! Groton and Townsend were definitely Weld towns, although my parents liked Silber"

763706931152322560,2016-08-11 12:01:36,I thought you might get a kick out of it!
763594871034839040,2016-08-11 04:36:18,I might have called in to Adler On-Line once or twice in high school...
763591848212434944,2016-08-11 04:24:18,(Further inducement: It includes near the beginning Silber imitating a horse)
763591219972829184,2016-08-11 04:21:48,If you liked our piece on John Silber tonight here is his *full* famous pre-election interview w/ Natalie Jacobson
763587280472801281,2016-08-11 04:06:09,"I know, just saying it made me laugh"
763586716879945728,2016-08-11 04:03:54,I do give Howie Carr credit for asking if his friends from Harvard were helping on the campaign
763585748356435968,2016-08-11 04:00:03,don't forget John lakian's implosion

763582639857135616,2016-08-11 03:47:42,that may or may not have been what I was thinking of when I sent this...
763574584146821120,2016-08-11 03:15:42,I was a college organizer that summer/early fall for one of the candidates to replace Joe K
763573231441903616,2016-08-11 03:10:19,I hope you also got to cover the landmark harshbarger-McGovern-Donnelly and cellucci-Malone primaries!
763570144228601856,2016-08-11 02:58:03,sounds like a fun project!
763569976246689792,2016-08-11 02:57:23,btw you guys spoiled me in '90 - that was my intro to political campaigns and I just assumed they'd all be that interesting
763568437322973184,2016-08-11 02:51:16,Because we didn't have minutes
763566892258828288,2016-08-11 02:45:08,interesting! Id never heard that.
763566601723637766,2016-08-11 02:43:58,"yes! totally different models. Blue collar Catholics liked cellucci, suburban good govt-types with harshbarger"

763563125819969540,2016-08-11 02:30:10,but thanks. I still like looking at it because you'll never see a map like that in MA again
763562978012725249,2016-08-11 02:29:34,so you were the guy who read it!
763561167835033601,2016-08-11 02:22:23,you deserve an honorary producer credit!
763560234430427136,2016-08-11 02:18:40,"looking back, I'm jealous of -- got to moderate one of the best-ever political debates"

763526881102721024,2016-08-11 00:06:08,I don't want to give it away either. I'll just say this is a segment I've been preparing for for years...
763430322860126208,2016-08-10 17:42:27,That should say *Kerry* by in '04

739956179732975616,2016-06-06 23:04:35,Well there is a difference. Pledged delegates are *require* to vote for the candidate they're pledged to. Supers aren't.
739955917257646084,2016-06-06 23:03:33,"I think there's some confusion over what Sanders is arguing when he says it will be a ""contested convention"":"
739953948166135808,2016-06-06 22:55:43,right - except he's arguing that *superdelegates* won't vote till the convention &amp; (unlike pledged) aren't formally bound
739946183712444417,2016-06-06 22:24:52,"no. It's ""theoretically possible but implausible."" You e added zero to this discussion, which I'm ending now."
739945972990681088,2016-06-06 22:24:02,which has nothing to do with the argument I addressed -- which is that superdelegates are not bound and can be flipped

739945517195612163,2016-06-06 22:22:13,no I didn't. I said he claims he can still win by flipping *superdelegates* and that this is theoretically possible but implausible
739944375120187393,2016-06-06 22:17:41,"in fact I believe my exact line was: ""she will have a majority of pledged delegates."""

739941715721752576,2016-06-06 22:07:07,"in fairness, I don't think that's what he's saying now. He's arguing that supers aren't locked in - that he can still win them"
739940454662328320,2016-06-06 22:02:06,And former Cruz aide Rick Tyler just said on that he doesn't think Cruz will make an endorsement
739939607756873729,2016-06-06 21:58:44,I didn't say you do!
739939492421853184,2016-06-06 21:58:17,yes but in the relevant examples not one individual superdelegate changed his/her mind - and Sanders would need hundreds
739934930906566657,2016-06-06 21:40:09,as I said: theoretically possible but superdelegates have never turned on a presumptive nominee post-primaries
739933924747546624,2016-06-06 21:36:09,that's really what you got out of that segment?
739912918049918976,2016-06-06 20:12:41,Some caucus states do. Adding in those that don't wouldn't alter the fact that she has a clear lead. And I said it's rough.

739573419931406336,2016-06-05 21:43:38,Totally agree. But I think that underscores how misplaced the Dem concern over what Sanders is now saying probably is.
739572334252556288,2016-06-05 21:39:19,"agreed. I don't know what he'll do, but I think it's possible he sounds very different a week or two from now."
739571290932056065,2016-06-05 21:35:10,The point is: Maybe Sanders battles to Philly. Maybe not. But Clinton '08 showed how quickly a posture can change *after* the primaries end.

734056249101287424,2016-05-21 16:20:22,this is the exact opposite of what Clinton herself was arguing years ago at this same moment
734055780937240576,2016-05-21 16:18:30,it's the same standard she set when she said simply winning pledged wasn't enough for Obama
734054648701722624,2016-05-21 16:14:00,yes that's the point! Sanders is saying she needs superdelegates to put her over the top. And she does.
734053310446067712,2016-05-21 16:08:41,the magic number is and the question was whether she can reach it *without* the help of superdelegates. The answer is no.
734052888499126272,2016-05-21 16:07:01,the question was whether she could reach the nomination threshold with pledged delegates alone. The answer is no.

733392511092166656,2016-05-19 20:22:55,The problem for Sanders is making up that gap would require performances in CA and NJ that are unimaginable given how he's fared elsewhere
