Snapchat is great because after a lit night you can go back and relive the shit you were too drunk to remember doing the night before
Lillard drops on the Warriors don't sleep on 'em

People gotta stop taking everything so literal
All of a sudden they love this new dude when last week it was the same post with a different guy in it
Females amaze me with how quickly they can go from one boyfriend to the next ü§î
I see no changes Wake up in the morning and I ask myself, "Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?"
yes, perfect!
so I support both the Heat and Cav's but obviously the Cav's more so because of Bron
I don't have a favorite team. Sports are beyond teams in these times. D-Wade was my favorite player in then LeBron in
you're not passionate about the NBA? Bro you post about the Warriors almost everyday lol
LeBron has been my favorite player since . You've liked the Warriors since they became good. No difference?
dude says in the regular season
nobody stopping Aldridge
: Mistakes are proof that you are trying.
Can't wait to be in Cali and be surrounded with all new people
I doubt it. Tough to trade away your best player. They might as well revand besides that though
: Ten different players hit treys as set NBA record with three-pointers - go -45 from deep, dominate Hawks, -98,‚Ä¶
: Congrats to on another awesome accomplishment. th on all-time postseason scoring list.
you think they'll lose him?!
I respect that bro. Really hoping the Bulls get everything figured out here soon
but everyone's different man. Now you're not going to change your mind...I just try to respect them for what they do best
I get that but how somebody is on the field isn't how they are in real life. You should read "How Chandions Think" sometime
kind of hard for me to understand hating someone you'll never know on a personal level
but you would like him if he was on the Bulls
salty bulls fans be like
: Cavs' percentages: -point range: % (18-for-27) -point range: % (6-for-21)
's at half. The playoff record is by Golden State
Cavs are winning -38...at half time
Crazy ending! Waiters pushed off no doubt though
Dude had last game. Now had going /21 from the field
Great game. Aldridge is insane...might be most underrated superstar in the league
Showers are great
Forgive them for they know not what they do
: LaMarcus and Kawhi: points Oklahoma City: It has been that kind of night in San Antonio.
Great (top of the league) team oriented offense/defense vs. -on-1 and one of the worst defenses in the league. What do you eect?!

well if it was because you was feeling yourself then I can respect that and not at all. Maybe old me but idk who that is atm
otherwise I wouldn't say anything at all
well then why are you even considering it? ü§îü§î I do enjoy testing you, just making you think a bit but that means I care

just saying...love yourself for you not for being better or worse than someone else that's the ego talking not your true self

The Blazers were one of the only teams to beat Golden State this year...when Lillard dropped
The Blazers have a better shot at taking out a Steph Curry-less GS team than the Chris Paul-less Clips do
Females these days have larger egos than guys do

And I don't say that to brag. I say it to make some of you realize your life can be great too! I've been through it all, it's never too late

So often in life people want others to love them more than anything else in the world. Did you ever realize that person could be you?
All of the bad things in life mold you into who you truly are. By running away from these fears you are running further from your true self

I feel like females like the idea of a relationship more than actually being in one
Idk why but I always feel x more confident after a shower
Life's too short to keep yourself surrounded by the wrong people
If somebody's holding you back from your potential you must cut them out immediately
when the present moment is all we will ever have
its okay to look in the future periodically but the problem is we live in the future/past and go to the present periodically
lmao, gotta love the trends celebs set and the people who follow them
the whole book is about staying in the present moment because we often look behind us and ahead but never app the moment
I'm sure with where you're at in life it'll help so much. Because you're constantly looking to the future with school n shit
that's exactly what the book does for you! I'm literally so excited for you
but it'll save you a lot of money in the future
you'll realize why people buy things for happiness. It will actually make you pissed at the shit you buy to fill voids lol
you'll understand yourself better than ever
it will help you see where I'm coming from and it's rather short but it's a complete mind fuck
please, please, please purchase the book: The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle!!
almost everybody does that!! Once you're in tuned with the connection of thinking/emotions life becomes beautiful
well to put it bluntly were just smart. Not just smart in the sense of intelligence but we're open minded about shit
that's all it comes down to. People are fearful of change and honestly being happy...so they continue to do what they do
but even you are beyond your years emotionally speaking so that's why these things make sense to you
mostly everybody accepts things for what they are. Without realizing that life can be whatever you want it to be
so some people never realize these things. Why would they? I used to be so stubborn I'd never accept new ideas
at I was chasing everything for the wrong reasons. That's how society molds us, and I'd say I'm beyond my years at
you'll understand more as your emotional intelligence eands, that is if you choose that route
it's different for everybody if you're closed minded, yes. But materials never end and you'll always be wanting more
social media makes everything seem different than it is. Social media is a poor representation of real life
these aren't my opinions, they are facts based on the psychology of your brain
the things that are fulfilling such as relationships, family, love, gratitude, etc. Basically not material items
That's my Twitter rant for the day but for real: money, jewelry, cars, houses, etc never end!!!
Barely any of you are going to be rich or even close. Stop trying to live a life of "luxury" and focus on the things in life that matter
