which begs the fact why wouldn't they be transparent about it? I'm not saying I'm right or wrong. Just stating some views man.
but they didn't hire ficial analysts.... they hired teachers... if it's budgetary then ppl should hold walker accountable
what if you don't have wifi at home? That's ur chance to use the web. Giving people free internet access % takes attention.
never said they had to, % could make people pay attention less. You're incentivized to use school wifi since it's free.
maybe so. But the fact they consulted "every teacher" leans to my point. Why would they do that if it was budgetary?
LMAO
bruh they'll easily find some other reason but it's % that as an excuse.
Dare I say wilmot pulls a trump esque policy here.
You can't force people to want to pay attention. They have to want to pay attention themselves.

yeah we are different but average fan won't know. But I get your point for sure m8
our views are just gonna differ. Obvi I didn't want cavs to win. But they deserved it. Warriors shit the bed &and; cavs showed up
no one will remember who he played. % of people couldn't name a single team MJ beat. You gotta win given the chance.
-0 is perfect tho. You can't argue against it. He cleaned up shop every time. To fail times is not good. Just my opinion.
not discrediting this finals. But -6 is not a great finals record.
Warriors will be looked at as the biggest choke artists in NBA history probably as well.
Also -6 in the finals is still piss poor. Lol
Can never hear about getting one for the land ever again. Thank god.

doesn't change the fact barca was dominated the whole match
someone did not watch barca struggle all game while Madrid dominated. Also a wrongly disallowed goal would've been -1.
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope, I hope you make it to the day you're years old
Only Madrid can whoop Barca and then lose to Wolfsburg in the same week. Never change Madrid.

Money doesn't transcend time but your eeriences will.
Travel people. The world is massive. Don't get stuck in one place your whole life. Eerience different cultures.
Find a balance and chase your dreams
But to truly be happy requires internal peace
So in that sense money is an indirect path to things that can grant you happiness
So money gives you access to eloring who you truly are
Money doesn't buy happiness, however money let's you elore things you can become passionate about
