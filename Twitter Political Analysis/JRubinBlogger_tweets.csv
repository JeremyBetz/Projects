862519087624314880,2017-05-11 04:05:49,that's what Rosenstein seems to be saying too. Using him as a pretext/cover story was idiotic
862517703994728448,2017-05-11 04:00:20,Can you ship frozen?
862516789963522048,2017-05-11 03:56:42,Mr. Rosenstein: Sessions and president used you to cover up an attempt to tamp down on Russia investigation. What'cha going to do?
862516326509817856,2017-05-11 03:54:51,A few of us noticed early on that Rosenstein's memo didn't make sense as the pretext and didn't read like…
862515925492391936,2017-05-11 03:53:16,would be an atrocity
862515828268437504,2017-05-11 03:52:52,Thinking Rosenstein wouldn't object to being the fall guy has to among Trump/Sessions' stupider moves

862515318048120833,2017-05-11 03:50:51,R lawmakers and conserv spinners: You cannot defend this. Just. Stop. He lied about the reason he fired the guy investigating him
862515076728852480,2017-05-11 03:49:53,"that would be the go-to chump, VP Mike Pence"

862513459912728577,2017-05-11 03:43:28,Having been lied to twice about Russia probe you'd think Pence would get mad or something
862513036216741889,2017-05-11 03:41:47,"All the ""no big deal"" and ""Trump was right to fire Comey over HRC emails"" look like imbeciles now"
862512653431951361,2017-05-11 03:40:15,shows how stupid they were that they thought this would work
862511485800640512,2017-05-11 03:35:37,"and would be concrete evidence offered reason was a lie, a scheme to impede Russia investigation"
862511195361878016,2017-05-11 03:34:28,He needs to appoint the special counsel first
862511033692426241,2017-05-11 03:33:49,and that would be obstruction folks
862510932223823872,2017-05-11 03:33:25,Told ya. He was duped into cooperating
862510704624062464,2017-05-11 03:32:31,We noted from start that Rosenstein memo looked like it was answering a different question than what admin was saying. Now we know it's true
862510402692947968,2017-05-11 03:31:19,wants to appoint special counsel first
862509924059938816,2017-05-11 03:29:25,notion that R's tried out that Trump ok cause he could fire FBI director absurd from get-go. Now it's embarrassing
862509677661368322,2017-05-11 03:28:26,"DAG threatening to quit Proves the obstruction, misuse of his memo. Conserv should get a clue, stop rationalizing"
862509156439347201,2017-05-11 03:26:22,some of us noticed that!
862509070313545728,2017-05-11 03:26:01,a pet rock would be too
862508719254515712,2017-05-11 03:24:37,should now quit and testify or appoint special counsel and testify
862508405231058944,2017-05-11 03:23:23,this guy is FABULOUS-- both parties should go consult and prep for next election
862508270610771968,2017-05-11 03:22:50,Thought so. The memo reads like the answer to a different question :
862507982269153280,2017-05-11 03:21:42,uh-oh. Rosenstein tell us firing memo pretextual and real reason was Russia probe? I suspected he w…

862468595380621313,2017-05-11 00:45:11,This is per se obstruction
862449542414954496,2017-05-10 23:29:29,So the proffered reason was fake and fired for Russia probe
