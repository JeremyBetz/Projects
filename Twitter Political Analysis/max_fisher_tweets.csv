869188932969406464,2017-05-29 13:49:25,The American debate over Iraq was so politicized that we mistook the damage to our alliances as just a partisan talking point. It wasn't.
869188571097423873,2017-05-29 13:47:58,"Americans are oblivious to this. We wrongly remember European objections to Iraq as purely political, or see them thru our own partisan lens"

868976748741963776,2017-05-28 23:46:16,All to say: Merkel's comment didn't come out of nowhere. Germans have spent months contemplating – and preparing for – a break with the US.

868971292212563971,2017-05-28 23:24:35,The Germans really fear Europe will fall apart w/o the US. But they saw Trump as a potential threat to their most core national interests.
868970627776098304,2017-05-28 23:21:57,They were quite open about their plan: appease Trump and proceed normally. But quietly prepare a Plan B in case that fails. We may be there.
