842124140744171523,2017-03-15 21:23:35,at no point have I defended Darren Wilson. I said that Root article and some tweets misrepresented what he said

842113387014283264,2017-03-15 20:40:51,"did you draw gun? Answer is ""yes"" - question doesn't address chronology or reason for drawing"
842113251559235589,2017-03-15 20:40:19,"reason he makes ""fist"" distinction is b/c directly relevant to question - did brown have weapon? According to Wilson, yes (fist)"
842112991017467908,2017-03-15 20:39:17,no. Because it wouldn't have been directly relevant to the question asked
842112175040823296,2017-03-15 20:36:02,it was never added to the questions. Wilson included in his response to each question referencing if brown had a weapon
842111746613612544,2017-03-15 20:34:20,no. This was not oral. brown family attorneys sent them a list of questions. Wilson sent back answers. no stopping/clarifying
842111147272765441,2017-03-15 20:31:57,that entire thread is wrong. The new document doesn't contradict Wilson's grand jury testimony
842110829151543303,2017-03-15 20:30:41,I actually don't understand what you're saying
842110240703279104,2017-03-15 20:28:21,the context was about who initiated physical contact. Could have been more clear - sorry
842110096352108545,2017-03-15 20:27:47,he's not asked if brown attacked him. This isn't a narrative document - it's a list of literal yes/no's
842109523720585220,2017-03-15 20:25:30,and the weapon clarification is essential to his justification of deadly force. Those other clarifications wouldn't be
842109203456106497,2017-03-15 20:24:14,"sure. But you can't responsibly assume that because they didn't interject, it means he's admitting that nothing else happened"
842106376637845504,2017-03-15 20:13:00,he didn't perjure himself
842105249380892683,2017-03-15 20:08:31,"no, he did not admit initiating contact. He only responds to ?s asked. Just cause something asked about doesn't mean didn't happen"

842092305590976521,2017-03-15 19:17:05,yes. From after Wilson drew the gun (tweeted earlier parts of transcript)
842091428830408704,2017-03-15 19:13:36,gun was unholstered for most of interaction. Brown never trying to unholster not same as Brown never reaching later
842090193695956992,2017-03-15 19:08:42,"Darren Wilson's grand jury testimony was Brown hit him so he drew his own gun, then Brown grabbed it"
842088259224252416,2017-03-15 19:01:00,The forensics/common sense raise significant questions about Wilson's story. But he doesn't change it here (I would have reported if he did)
842087941614755840,2017-03-15 18:59:45,he could have (and presumably) done that after gun was drawn
842087802963660801,2017-03-15 18:59:12,Wilson admits he drew the gun himself. Gun wasn't holstered during most of interaction
842087459622133760,2017-03-15 18:57:50,and that allegation is not addressed/broached in this document
842087343678996480,2017-03-15 18:57:22,questioning under oath is dense and specific. That's the point
842087190742065153,2017-03-15 18:56:46,"no. At point does this document address whether Brown ""reached for gun"""
842085322355818497,2017-03-15 18:49:20,my read of the new document is that it says none of these things
842085080956829696,2017-03-15 18:48:23,there is nothing I've seen in Dec admissions from Darren Wilson that materially alters/contradicts his previous version of the story.

824113470673186816,2017-01-25 04:35:37,multiple task forces already exist in chicago tho.... Trump tweet implies new/different federal involvement
824112037735387136,2017-01-25 04:29:55,appears FBI/ATF are already involved in stemming homicides in Chicago
824110712956026886,2017-01-25 04:24:39,: Here's and with the latest on Trump's tweet:
824110669637255170,2017-01-25 04:24:29,"did, in either of these cases, the federal involvement happen without local request?"
824108123401162753,2017-01-25 04:14:22,": Re: POTUS's Chicago tweet- There's precedent for feds coming to stem murder spike. Did it in '11 in PG Co., Maryland"
824107830089281536,2017-01-25 04:13:12,my thought too. Trump tweet suggests federal seizing of power - as opposed to eansion of federal assistance
824107503512330240,2017-01-25 04:11:54,"trump said he'd ""send in the feds"" - implies a new eansion, not more of involvement that is already happening"
824106870499643395,2017-01-25 04:09:23,"yeah, that would be my assumption to. since Trump tweets without specifics, hard to know what to make of it"
824106380743340032,2017-01-25 04:07:26,"yes. Also Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland etc - but was about police killings, not homicides."
824106046910300161,2017-01-25 04:06:07,is federal partnership not already happening in Chicago? (appreciate this link)
824105783164026880,2017-01-25 04:05:04,Sessions has said he thinks use of DOJ consent decrees to upend local PDs are federal overreach
824105640280920065,2017-01-25 04:04:30,that's most constitutional option i can think of - but Sessions on record saying consent decrees are fed overreach
824104619961962496,2017-01-25 04:00:27,fed investigators never been used that way re: homicides. Fascinating if Trump would employ them that way...

824103750881210369,2017-01-25 03:56:59,"so, if Spicer's statement in Dec stands, I'm pretty sure Trump just threatened a Constitutional crisis in Chicago"

824100407274311680,2017-01-25 03:43:42,"in that context, as a reporter, what does taking him ""seriously but not literally"" even mean?"
824100290148364294,2017-01-25 03:43:14,Trump - the leader of the free world - just hinted at unprecedented and possibly unconstitutional intervention in Chicago PD
824100087903223809,2017-01-25 03:42:26,"this is the flaw of the ""take trump seriously, not literally"" logic..."
824099646880579584,2017-01-25 03:40:41,and seems a highly unlikely thing for Rahm/cook county to do. really can't see how Trump could pull off fed intervention
824098312198492160,2017-01-25 03:35:23,federal intervention in a local police department due to homicide levels - to my knowledge (tell me if wrong) - is unprecedented

824091881332240385,2017-01-25 03:09:50,(to be clear that would be unprecedented use of DOJ investigatory power and i'm not positive is even allowed)
824091726025474054,2017-01-25 03:09:13,the only work around i can think of would be to argue that homicide levels violate civil rights/launch an investigation
824091192652627968,2017-01-25 03:07:05,most likely - i think - is Pres. Trump doesn't understand limits of fed authority in local police jurisdiction and is just impulse tweeting
824090768193228800,2017-01-25 03:05:24,"unprecedented, and don't think they'd ever do/don't know if they even could - but is only avenue i can think of"
