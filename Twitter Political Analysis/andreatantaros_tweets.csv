765639163286736896,2016-08-16 19:59:36,UNFORGIVABLE to families of those lost capturing these terrorists &amp; our SOF now in harm's way bc of their release
765637918295674880,2016-08-16 19:54:39,According to Obama's own ultra-liberal Gitmo Review Board these terrorists were deemed too dangerous to transfer.
765635601567588352,2016-08-16 19:45:26,UNJUSTIFIABLE. These are the worst of the worst: Pentagon releases more Gitmo detainees
761324992843743232,2016-08-04 22:16:37,Obama takes ISIS threat to US so 'seriously' his Admin still can't find Orlando shooter Omar Mateen's wife &amp; media hasn't bothered to ask.
761320008236412928,2016-08-04 21:56:49,"If Obama logic alleges GOP 'rhetoric' exacerbates the Sunni ISIS threat, I wonder what Obama secretly funneling Shia Iran $400m does."
761315678951399424,2016-08-04 21:39:37,"Obama today said the threat ISIS poses to the US is serious. So serious, his Admin had intelligence reports scrubbed of any mention of them."
761314676265201664,2016-08-04 21:35:38,"Obama March , : ""They [ISIS] are not an existential threat to the US."" Obama today on threat ISIS poses to the US: ""It's serious."""
761312752467976193,2016-08-04 21:27:59,Except that Democrats rigged their entire primary (and FBI investigation) to ensure a Hillary win against Sanders.
760658667914027008,2016-08-03 02:08:53,"When Obama said he would lead from behind, I didn't think it meant following Tehran."
760651365228044289,2016-08-03 01:39:52,Turkey's Islamist authoritarian leader is bullying Obama into favorable policies using our nukes. US media yawns.
759774639274856448,2016-07-31 15:36:04,This is only happening bc Congress demanded it. Obama's IRS will 'investigate' and say they found nothing.
759773602434523137,2016-07-31 15:31:57,FBI Dir Comey still must elain to Congress why Hillary wasn't sworn under oath like every other subject of a high-profile investigation.
758867104292483072,2016-07-29 03:29:51,It would be a much bigger moment for women if the st female nominee didn't need to fake a marriage with a serial cheater to get here.
758861396998139904,2016-07-29 03:07:10,Hillary doesn't represent all women. She's only ever fought for elevating and advancing the interests and pursuits of one woman: herself.
758856532414963712,2016-07-29 02:47:50,I'd love to be more excited about a woman accepting a nomination for President. It is a huge deal for women. I just wish it weren't her.
758852694979190788,2016-07-29 02:32:35,Watching this...how could anyone ever think or question whether or not Hillary would be indicted by the same party throwing this convention.
758849013655318528,2016-07-29 02:17:58,Hillary is very lucky to have Chelsea. Nobody has ever done a better job than she just did trying to convince us that Hillary has a soul.
758515658925629442,2016-07-28 04:13:20,Whoever thought it was a good idea for Obama to lecture about self-appointed saviors also saw no irony in this one:
758513964544176129,2016-07-28 04:06:36,"Obama's speech was well written &amp; delivered, but entirely out of touch with the last years and where we are as a nation."
758512209446055936,2016-07-28 03:59:37,"Days after having their party's entire nominating process eed as a rigged game, how can Obama lecture anyone about democracy?"
758507176822345730,2016-07-28 03:39:37,Dems have spent past yrs trying to convince us Hillary is too confused to work email &amp; now she's the most intelligent candidate ever?
758500934682935296,2016-07-28 03:14:49,There has never been a woman more qualified to be President than the woman who can't name a single accomplishment of hers to Wolf Blitzer.
757783750511951872,2016-07-26 03:44:59,"Michelle Obama on Hillary: ""She's never quit on anything in her life."" I would beg to differ."
757767299948511232,2016-07-26 02:39:37,Darn-missed my cameo. Was watching a (slightly) less fake contest where the outcome isn't as rigged
757378422146424832,2016-07-25 00:54:21,The irony is that they call themselves DEMOCRATS
757375655994466305,2016-07-25 00:43:22,That pretty much sums it up. cc: Gen. David Petraeus
757361213634260992,2016-07-24 23:45:59,"Hillary has email scandal, she gets nominated. Wasserman Schultz has email scandal, she gets fired. Democrats are making women look bad."
757358173812432896,2016-07-24 23:33:54,So THIS is where Democrats draw the line on email scandals?
757355989016293377,2016-07-24 23:25:13,How perfect. Hillary Clinton will be giving us a look inside the mind of a political bully &amp; modern day mean girl.
757194330666770432,2016-07-24 12:42:51,"Funny, the same excuse Hillary gives us for all her 'mistakes' is same quality the left heaped on Sarah Palin: gross &amp; serial incompetence."
757192650864721922,2016-07-24 12:36:10,"After hysteria over a Jewish star tweet, not sure what's worse: fact that the DNC is filled w bigots or hypocrites."
757188930949095424,2016-07-24 12:21:23,"What a revelation: the DNC is chalk full of intolerant, hypocritical bigots."
756130462159007745,2016-07-21 14:15:25,"Now that the global scandal of Melania ripping off words has passed, can we get back to how Obama lied to Congress about the Iran deal?"
755060625181585408,2016-07-18 15:24:16,President Obama thinks that his legacy is all our fault.
755047199843639298,2016-07-18 14:30:55,Wonder which is more interesting: transcript of the hr meeting btwn Bill Clinton &amp; Trump before he announced or Bill Clinton &amp; AG Lynch.
755016833795710977,2016-07-18 12:30:15,Appears Erdogen staged coup to make Turkey a purer Islamist authoritarian state. Time to reassess NATO membership.
754728798961139712,2016-07-17 17:25:42,"Liberals insist that counter-Islamist rhetoric provokes jihad. So will they admit liberal, anti-cop rhetoric inspires violence against cops?"
754726812261847040,2016-07-17 17:17:48,Duty. Honor. Courage. God Bless the Blue.
754723730039853056,2016-07-17 17:05:33,"America is in crisis &amp; the Admin is still denying division, ISIS threats &amp; insisting the most pressing issues are birth control &amp; bathrooms."
754717811918802944,2016-07-17 16:42:02,"Terrorism should never be, nor does it have to be, the new normal. The French (AND US) can &amp; must change policies."
754714312782995456,2016-07-17 16:28:08,"Doesn't sound like ""shared principles of justice &amp; progress; tolerance and the dignity of all human beings"" to me..."
754324646716141568,2016-07-16 14:39:45,An absolute must read on what a potential Hillary VP pick is up to that will radically transform America's suburbs:
754041895379021824,2016-07-15 19:56:11,How can Hillary praise Obama's counter-terrorism effort when the Administration still can't locate Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen's wife?
754028301824368640,2016-07-15 19:02:10,"Only Hillary, who presided over the foreign policy failures of the O Admin as Secretary of State, could praise Obama after a terror attack."
754023302545367040,2016-07-15 18:42:19,He should have.
753939947170652161,2016-07-15 13:11:05,Can't it wait til Monday? There's only so much disappointment a person can handle from one campaign in a week.
753933881829580800,2016-07-15 12:46:59,If O Admin worked as hard at defeating ISIS as they do scrubbing any mention of them from intel reports &amp; transcripts they'd be nonexistent.
753931845167828992,2016-07-15 12:38:53,"The Saudis aren't going to be happy about this, but the Obama Admin's new business partners in Tehran will be."
753749555879907328,2016-07-15 00:34:32,"ISIS striking France on , the seismic event which saw France go from a cowed monarchy to a proud republic, cannot be lost."
753218520222093312,2016-07-13 13:24:24,The United States has fallen and it can't get up.
752887854955503616,2016-07-12 15:30:27,Guess Bernie got tired of having someone start his car for him every morning.
752885077504176128,2016-07-12 15:19:25,"This is how deceitful the Obama Admin is...the State Dept wasn't going to announce this news, but the Iranians did."

751881493664960513,2016-07-09 20:51:32,Today Obama said: 'America isn't as divided as some have suggested.' Guess he forgot he's the one that suggested it.
751869134124777472,2016-07-09 20:02:25,"Oh, this is rich."
751868298833203200,2016-07-09 19:59:06,The families of five deceased Dallas police officers beg to differ.
751867306423230464,2016-07-09 19:55:09,Completely and eerily detached from reality
751487403584434176,2016-07-08 18:45:33,"Somehow, embracing Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat's wife seems far worse than a tweet."
751477411384922112,2016-07-08 18:05:51,Single women are too cheap or too lazy to handle tasks themselves. There's a word for this but it's not feminism.
751152066878328832,2016-07-07 20:33:03,Western media yawns. Moves on to more critical stories like Trump getting a fact wrong about the constitution today.
751115387794812928,2016-07-07 18:07:18,The most honest admission by FBI Director Comey during his Capitol Hill testimony was that he had to go to the bathroom for an hour.
751090123228393472,2016-07-07 16:26:54,"Hillary allowing her lawyers, who didn't have a security clearance, access to her classified emails is in and of itself a felony."
751081542315700224,2016-07-07 15:52:48,That isn't for him to decide. Comey is not a prosecutor. His job is to investigate. This is a complete whitewash.
751079834692882432,2016-07-07 15:46:01,"To say that she didn't lie to the FBI, and to the American people, is an absolute lie."
751076373859479552,2016-07-07 15:32:16,Comey sounds more like Clinton's defense attorney than the Director of the FBI.
751075591982428161,2016-07-07 15:29:10,"Comey: Clinton might not be ""sophisticated"" enough to note ""c"" for classified. Pretty damaging argument for someone running for President."
751074358118854657,2016-07-07 15:24:15,"FBI Director Comey testifying on Capitol Hill: ""Hillary set up her private email server for convenience."" SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT OPTION."
750886993224171520,2016-07-07 02:59:44,The Obama Admin seems as concerned with his disappearance as they are with finding Omar Mateen's missing wife.
750877027381743616,2016-07-07 02:20:08,Republicans who insisted how fair FBI Dir Comey was for months don't remember the political Hospital Standoff he pulled vs. the Bush Admin.
750826406024663040,2016-07-06 22:58:59,Being right all the time is getting exhausting.
750818640711135232,2016-07-06 22:28:08,Full blown degeneracy of government as they all cover for her. This is the most corrupt Administration in history.
750449850462773248,2016-07-05 22:02:41,"Translation: conspiracy &amp; criminality on multiple acts yet no punishment. If you're in the ruling class, you skate."
750428991920574464,2016-07-05 20:39:48,Comey has always been political. Bucking the Bush WH arguably made him Obama's FBI director:
750412419093000192,2016-07-05 19:33:57,"Under an Administration that isn't corrupt, EACH one below is a felony; some are multiple felonies in one event."
750411365072769024,2016-07-05 19:29:46,"An indictment was never happening. Hillary's actions aren't an outlier, but the M.O. of an entirely lawless Admin."
750000538079592448,2016-07-04 16:17:17,To courageous and valiant Warriors past and present: thank you. We're the land of the free…
749446040097464320,2016-07-03 03:33:54,One presidential candidate was interviewed by the FBI today. The other deleted a tweet. Guess which one got more news coverage?
748982729518125056,2016-07-01 20:52:52,This is the most corrupt Admin in history. EXCLUSIVE: State Dept Won’t Release Clinton Foundation Emails for Mos
748852268607238144,2016-07-01 12:14:28,"Why now, of all times, would the Obama Admin do this? RT Homeland Security pushes to ban words 'sharia' and 'jihad'"
748847576661659648,2016-07-01 11:55:49,FBI can now easily spy on journalists. MSM should be all over this but they're busy covering Trump's dental records.
748340718196883456,2016-06-30 02:21:45,Farage on fire. US politicians take note.
748273442009452544,2016-06-29 21:54:25,"If gifting fake cufflinks like Trump makes u a liar in the media's eyes, what does having a fake marriage make you?"
748156277453258752,2016-06-29 14:08:51,"At best, Hillary is so incompetent she couldn't protect her people or her emails. How does she deserve a promotion?"
748144060087435264,2016-06-29 13:20:18,Turkey's Erdogan aids ISIS by smuggling arms to Syria &amp; prosecutes journalists who report it. The Obama Admin is on both sides of this...
748141553420382209,2016-06-29 13:10:20,"You can't see me, but I'm whistling and looking at the floor."
747975525956722688,2016-06-29 02:10:36,"But Turkish President Erdogan refuses to say ISIS or ISIL &amp; said the attack ""has no objective."" Sound familiar?"
747851935793844225,2016-06-28 17:59:30,May their memory be eternal. 8.05
747793420425531393,2016-06-28 14:06:59,"The whole point of this pronounced, political conclusion is an ill-conceived overcompensation to buoy the GOP brand"
747791538688765952,2016-06-28 13:59:30,The US military can't move an inch w/out authorization from the Executive Branch esp when they're told to stand down
747783809886617600,2016-06-28 13:28:48,Read this. When whistleblowers flag known jihadists the Obama Admin targets them &amp; then covers up for the jihadists.
747451997486407680,2016-06-27 15:30:17,While the media is busily (and absurdly) asking if Trump caused this morning nobody is asking where Omar Mateen's missing wife is...
747438291574755328,2016-06-27 14:35:50,This is a real headline in America in . At least they're not hiding their desire for dictatorial rule anymore.
746316927279169536,2016-06-24 12:19:56,Congratulations to the UK for having the courage to determine its own fate.
746289042963177472,2016-06-24 10:29:07,Good for them. UK voters just saved their country.
746156128527015936,2016-06-24 01:40:58,We watched the media doggedly pursue escaped NY inmates for DAYS until killed. Mateen's wife escaped FBI eyes &amp; media could care less.
746153687345565697,2016-06-24 01:31:16,"Except for the hundreds of witnesses &amp; testimony from past lovers, nada."

745968978007228416,2016-06-23 13:17:18,I wonder if they would work this hard to diminish other constitutional rights like freedom of the press?
745621933266460672,2016-06-22 14:18:16,"Says he ""changed his mind,"" which politicians do constantly. Like that he started his campaign w an authentic answer"
745248005830250498,2016-06-21 13:32:25,The Admin deleted radical Islam from the transcript. The mainstream media has now deleted radical Islam from the national conversation.
745246585840230402,2016-06-21 13:26:46,Yesterday the Senate voted to pass 'groundbreaking legislation' to address problems that don't exist. This is why people hate Washington.
744734443676524548,2016-06-20 03:31:42,To anyone still not thinking Obama's DOJ won't indict Hillary take a look. They think they can get away w/ anything.
744698354593046530,2016-06-20 01:08:18,"Admin scrubs Islamic terror from: Benghazi talking points, intel reports, Orlando transcript etc. We won't survive more years of this."
