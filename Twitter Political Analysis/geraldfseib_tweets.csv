629647093636968448,2015-08-07 13:35:40,An awesome recap of last night's debate in four charts:
629488329847930880,2015-08-07 03:04:47,Trump closes by saying we can't do anything right in America..Not exactly an optimistic note.
629479823438684161,2015-08-07 02:30:59,Jeb Bush is trying to sound presidential while standing next to Donald Trump who says there isn't time for that sort of thing.
