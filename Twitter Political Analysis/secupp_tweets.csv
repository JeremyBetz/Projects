788932911613423616,2016-10-20 02:40:38,: . had a great discussion with recently about .
788927905912922112,2016-10-20 02:20:44,"Sorry, Mr. Trump, if Aleppo had fallen, Assad and Putin wouldn't be bombing hospitals and schools. It hasn't fallen. It is under siege."
788925996971888640,2016-10-20 02:13:09,"OMG, HRC promises no American boots on the ground in Iraq. There are American boots on the ground in Mosel right now."

788918919708807168,2016-10-20 01:45:02,"This could change, but Chris Wallace has been much tougher on Clinton than Trump so far."
788916075945529344,2016-10-20 01:33:44,"Trump has been restrained thus far, and on message. She's starting to get under his skin though."
788915632779558912,2016-10-20 01:31:58,HRC: Putin would rather have a puppet for president. Good line.

788909841871888386,2016-10-20 01:08:58,That wasn't a slamdunk from Hillary Clinton on SCOTUS. She needed to draw a dramatic distinction between him and her. She was milquetoast.
