262750367446618112,2012-10-29 02:59:03,I think America is currently in a Cold Civil War:
262747489898209280,2012-10-29 02:47:37,"Mitt's disapproval rating after years as bipartisan governor was %. For some reason, he didn't run for re-election:"
262286024447774722,2012-10-27 20:13:55,Gallup/Rasmussen and the rest of the polls are in two completely different universes:
261901695137767426,2012-10-26 18:46:44,Let me cite three areas where I think the difference between Obama and Romney is a deep and moral one:
261875796057133056,2012-10-26 17:03:49,"This election we're fighting cumulative, snow-balling, post-modern, cynical faction of deceit and partisan amnesia:"
261552245093576704,2012-10-25 19:38:09,To etch-a-sketch just as vast numbers of low information voters tune in to first debate was stroke of cynical genius:
261535315783725056,2012-10-25 18:30:53,I have put my conscience before authority. Romney put authority before conscience. And my church has apologized:
261534847850397696,2012-10-25 18:29:01,"If football teams change their names to obliterate even a hint of racism, why is a major university still named after a vicious racist?"

261509632697184257,2012-10-25 16:48:49,Romney is a chilling shape-shifter who played a far right candidate for nine months and Mr Rogers for one:
261153359522840576,2012-10-24 17:13:07,The Obama campaign talking up Mitt's momentum might actually help Obama fight complacency. Here's hoping it does:

260767916771921921,2012-10-23 15:41:30,"Romney last night was peace candidate, after long campaign of being war candidate: And day after he wins - who knows?"

253677510653526017,2012-10-04 02:06:46,And Obama is still looking down. Did no one tell him there is a split screen? Just political malpractice.
253677324862636034,2012-10-04 02:06:02,"Finally, Obama thanks Romney for Obamacare. The first time he actually turned the tables. Staggering it took him an hour to get there."
253677264514973696,2012-10-04 02:05:47,I simply cannot believe that Mitt Romney is saying he is more bipartisan than Obama. And Obama never pushes back.
253675931426766848,2012-10-04 02:00:29,Romney is now so clearly lying about how Obama decided to do healthcare before jobs I wonder if he's over-reaching.
253674669243240448,2012-10-04 01:55:28,How Obama has managed to give Romney the advantage on Medicare in this exchange is political malpractice.
253674455329542146,2012-10-04 01:54:37,Romney is dominating Lehrer. And the debate. Just in pure alpha male terms.
253674403399860225,2012-10-04 01:54:25,"I notice that as soon as Obama starts to speak, the green line of male approval goes down. It's the gender gap illustrated live."

253671450303668224,2012-10-04 01:42:41,: Romney's Medicaid plan is not real. It is simply not real. It's a budget gimmick that shifts burdens to states.

253668252394336256,2012-10-04 01:29:58,Romney is running on Bowles-Simpson! And he's relating it to alleviating human suffering. Devastating round for Obama.

253665035845509122,2012-10-04 01:17:12,"But when Romney actually said that he wasn't cutting taxes for the very wealthy, it seems completely out of sync with his actual proposal."
