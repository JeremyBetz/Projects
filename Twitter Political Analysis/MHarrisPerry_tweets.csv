527467156846682114,2014-10-29 14:29:04,And Dems most forcefully distancing themselves from POTUS tend to be Southern where most need a diverse turnout.
527466743892291585,2014-10-29 14:27:26,I think Dems distancing from POTUS is bad strategy. Midterms are about the base. Base still supports POTUS
527466173060116481,2014-10-29 14:25:10,"Students can learn surge-decline of POTUS v. midterms, effects of new districts, effects of ""lame duck"" incumbent."
527465775872098305,2014-10-29 14:23:35,I think Ebola will have little impact on outcomes Hard to see it as motivator for voters unsure about turning out.
527465138832801792,2014-10-29 14:21:03,But many argue the Founders felt frequent elections are the best term limits because the voters decide limit.
527464651223998464,2014-10-29 14:19:07,Honestly I am a fan of term limits given the influence of $ and difficulty of recruiting new/ diverse candidates.
527464141477658625,2014-10-29 14:17:05,But if one's mayoral race is all about foreign policy that is probably not useful.
527463872354324482,2014-10-29 14:16:01,Nat'l issues tend to drive Congressional races because they are nat'l lawmakers even if elected locally.
527463560319078401,2014-10-29 14:14:47,Well polls show little chance of defeating Graham in SC. But voting is *always* important. Crucial local races matter.
527463213764730882,2014-10-29 14:13:24,Youth vote typically drops in midterms. Info &amp; direct contact seems to be most important to getting youth to polls.
527462587525758976,2014-10-29 14:10:55,Tough to call NC race. Hagan only wins if there is massive turnout. Not yet clear if that will happen.
527462337071300608,2014-10-29 14:09:55,Whoops. ..Important to remember there is more than one leader of the GOP.

527461322158800896,2014-10-29 14:05:53,Some sources &amp; polls are better than others. The key is to read many sources &amp; take margin of error seriously.

527460540860596224,2014-10-29 14:02:47,I think that there's so much reasonable excitement about the marriage equality victories that Trans-rights have been less central

454294667702444032,2014-04-10 16:27:43,I take very seriously the idea that we need affirming spaces At the same time I worry about policed boundaries.
454294452954079232,2014-04-10 16:26:52,Say that again And let me ask: who counts as a black girl and what counts as love &amp; support?
454294200951922689,2014-04-10 16:25:52,: if hashtags did NOTHING else but make black girls feel loved and supported if only by each other. that ALONE is worth it …
454294050032451584,2014-04-10 16:25:16,"Formerly I used Twitter to ask Qs, play w/ ideas. But now w/ TV show, tweets are presumed to be stating opinion."
454293607025876992,2014-04-10 16:23:30,Yes . TV is still so powerful. I find it strange to be in a position to wield some small part of that power.
454293119786565632,2014-04-10 16:21:34,"Useful. Say more. MT . I just have to add that activism is not the same as organizing. It can be, but often isn't."
454292625323855872,2014-04-10 16:19:36,Please say more . I want to hear this critique.
454292211278950400,2014-04-10 16:17:58,Ok your TL is such a good example of the TV/Twitter alliance. Is it a productive relationship?
454291999240097792,2014-04-10 16:17:07,Again that is certainly true for me . If something trends in my TL I pay attention. It's initiated a lot of learning.
454291756473782272,2014-04-10 16:16:09,Well hello there ! An example of an actual friendship that started on Twitter.
454291620909682688,2014-04-10 16:15:37,": I'd argue that while Twitter doesn't exactly provide ""Access"" it does influence national conversations... …"
454291597123809280,2014-04-10 16:15:31,": Even if social media may give the illusion of access to institutions, it democratized information."
454291536146997248,2014-04-10 16:15:17,So it goes to what we're trying to accomplish w/ Twitter. More ppl means more influence but maybe less substance?
454291212732608512,2014-04-10 16:14:00,Well I liked Twitter far more when I had followers. Real conversation &amp; genuine friendships. Now lots of noise
454290813153849344,2014-04-10 16:12:24,": For me, I've learned more about racial justice, trans* rights, white privilege, cis privilege &amp; more on Twitter than e…"

454290173652508672,2014-04-10 16:09:52,"Ok this is a really big claim. Do you think Twitter activism has reduced racist, sexist utterances and/or policies?"
454289617525542912,2014-04-10 16:07:39,"Ok now I want to produce a whole segment on ""the right to tweet"""

454289322703720448,2014-04-10 16:06:29,"This is so important Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, Renisha McBride are all examples of Twitter influence."
454289099327692800,2014-04-10 16:05:36,: Analysis of online activism shows impact can be traced. See for example the case study
454288694304710656,2014-04-10 16:03:59,Yeah I'm terrible at the characters. As an academic I always have far too many words!
454288526951985152,2014-04-10 16:03:19,"Many saying Twitter challenges privilege. But is it ""opiate of the people"" creating illusion of access while powerful govern?"
454287522273583104,2014-04-10 15:59:20,Seems to me that Twitter might have similar track record of failures that nonetheless create space for later success.
454287298360651776,2014-04-10 15:58:26,And shows how these *failures* actually laid groundwork for future successes of Civil Rights Movement.

454286703184711681,2014-04-10 15:56:04,We see this in campaign assessments. Winning candidates must have had good strategy. Not necessarily. Many factors contribute.
454286517385441280,2014-04-10 15:55:20,"A challenge of assessing any activist strategies, Twitter included, is we presume *failing* means strategy was bad."
454286144998760448,2014-04-10 15:53:51,"This is very helpful to me . ""Listening is invisible"" I listen on Twitter much more than I speak."
454285836666691584,2014-04-10 15:52:38,Yes . That's our goal. was on this weekend. Time ran out. We decided to bring convo here.
454285509565505536,2014-04-10 15:51:20,"Yes For me, is an ideal example of the value of discursive work initiated on twitter."
454285239309713409,2014-04-10 15:50:15,Here is my Q back to you . How do we get to substantive criticism in w/o being overwhelmed by trolls?
454284781363023872,2014-04-10 15:48:26,Yes Hashtag has done that for me. I was called out on Twitter for cis-privilege. Been working on it.
454284284556107777,2014-04-10 15:46:28,"Possible Twitter to be highly effective tools for action in some contexts, some nations, some moments &amp; not others"
454284037033426944,2014-04-10 15:45:29,"Great Q all media take on relative power, influence depending on context. Impact of Twitter isn't same in all places."
454283627933597697,2014-04-10 15:43:51,"Q2 my fave example of Twitter power: Austin, TX reproductive justice movement at state Capital. MSM missed it, Twitter had it."
454283082309201920,2014-04-10 15:41:41,For example I see rape threats routinely directed women &amp; rarely men. But there's plenty of hate trolling of men.
454282811118088192,2014-04-10 15:40:37,Do you think there is *more* trolling of racial minorities? I see it as different but not greater volume.
