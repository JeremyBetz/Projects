803351590342131712,2016-11-28 21:35:19,Actually way below average for a winner's total: —525 —489 —426 —379 —370 —365 —332 *20…
803319723270303745,2016-11-28 19:28:41,": Why do the people who comment on the Internet do what they do? asked ,500 of them to find out."
803308210673352710,2016-11-28 18:42:56,"Also, there's no reason to confine the audit to PA, WI and MI. If you're going to audit, audit everywhere, including states Clinton won."
803307114231898113,2016-11-28 18:38:35,An election audit probably won't change anything and will lead to a lot of spurious claims. But I support it anyway:
803225881707544576,2016-11-28 13:15:48,": Please though, let's lay the blame on ""fake"" news."

803024227297173504,2016-11-27 23:54:29,: I'm not sure because a lot of it is outlet-specific. The NYT has had... issues with Clinton for years.
803022139079217152,2016-11-27 23:46:12,"The more sophisticated complaint is not about how outlets like NYT covered Trump, but how they covered Clinton."
802981797055303680,2016-11-27 21:05:53,": ""Trump’s just distracting us from TK!"" has become the sort of lazy, catch-all CW that we'd eect Jack Shafer to warn us about."
802980257464774656,2016-11-27 20:59:46,: Too cute by half. The business interests story is less threatening to Trump's legitimacy than the popular vote &amp; recount stuff.
802978520813174784,2016-11-27 20:52:52,: Hamilton tweets not in the same ballpark -- or the same hemisphere -- as calling the legitimacy of the election into question.
802963219467948032,2016-11-27 19:52:04,"So the idea that NYT was ""just reporting the news"" doesn't work. It made choices and should defend them (or admit its critics have a point)."
802962052553777152,2016-11-27 19:47:26,"The NYT makes very aggressive, narrative-shaping editorial choices instead of taking a more open, pluralistic view:"
802960914622414848,2016-11-27 19:42:54,Even if you have the resources to cover the campaign fully -- and nobody does -- you're constantly making choices about tone and emphasis.
802959482078826496,2016-11-27 19:37:13,"Maybe after an earthquake or a bank robbery, it's obvious ""what's news"" and what isn't. Not with something as complex as an election."

802925525576613888,2016-11-27 17:22:17,I'd argue that Trump's behavior since the election reduces the invasiveness of the procedure. Organs of democracy already a bit damaged. (9/
802923740820598785,2016-11-27 17:15:12,Think of recount as a test for a rare medical condition. A test can be costly depending on how invasive it is and chance of false positives.
802920892296785920,2016-11-27 17:03:52,…before your suspicions are aroused too much. Also look toward the Clinton campaign which will take a cautious view:

802915801833607168,2016-11-27 16:43:39,"So it's not really a ""recount"". Not about a few votes here and there. It's more like an audit or an investigation into possible fraud. (3/"

802550667923652612,2016-11-26 16:32:44,My take: Castro has redeeming facets but his pitch-framing not enough to compensate for inability to make contact.
802272157954781185,2016-11-25 22:06:02,"The FBI, and the media's coverage of it, probably had a lot more impact on the election than ""fake news"" or Russian hackers did."
802200073375510529,2016-11-25 17:19:36,"Not saying this Jill Stein thing is a scam, but if it were a scam, it would probably look a lot like this."

801509701561225216,2016-11-23 19:36:18,Patterns in Trump's vote in swing states are well-elained by demographics—not hacking:

801220813890277376,2016-11-23 00:28:22,To follow: some *very* quick analysis which suggests the claim here of rigged results in Wisconsin is probably BS:

801084136056377344,2016-11-22 15:25:16,"Also, whiter counties shifted more toward Trump. So anything correlated with whiteness—heroin use?—will also be correlated with POTUS vote."
801083489475031040,2016-11-22 15:22:41,So any indicator correlated with education will be correlated with the presidential vote. Even a quick study ought to control for that.
801083029531820033,2016-11-22 15:20:52,"At the county level, the correlation between education levels and the vote shift from '12 to '16 is quite high (about .6)."

761344969911263236,2016-08-04 23:36:00,"There's a point at which these national polls, bad as they are for Trump, become redundant. Need to see where race is -3 weeks from now."
761339685885112321,2016-08-04 23:15:00,"Clinton at % in our polls-only forecast and % in polls-plus, close to her all-time highs."
761319036928032772,2016-08-04 21:52:57,: Trump's polling well in Celsius.
761197864936738816,2016-08-04 13:51:28,"Those models assume race will tighten some. If you held an election now Trump would get crushed, with GA &amp; AZ as toss-ups per our now-cast."
761196353171120128,2016-08-04 13:45:27,Clinton now % to win in our polls-plus model. % in polls-only.
761043014911307777,2016-08-04 03:36:08,"Trump has a chance, because he may be able to drag Clinton down to his level. That will be despite rather than because of Trump, however."
761041939898572802,2016-08-04 03:31:52,"Perhaps the worst take is the ""Trump's actually doing well to only be down by !!!"" take. He's the least popular major-party nominee ever."
761038333124366336,2016-08-04 03:17:32,: I'd have assumed she was up . Seems like a Trump surge.
760991921661702144,2016-08-04 00:13:07,Fitness-for-office is both Clinton's largest comparative advantage and—given his indiscipline—the hardest critique for Trump to respond to.
760989458447626240,2016-08-04 00:03:20,There are so many ways to attack Trump that you risk losing the thread unless you focus on or maybe major themes.
760988010301251584,2016-08-03 23:57:34,Obviously helps Clinton that Trump keeps stepping in it. But she deserves some credit for making Trump's fitness-for-office a focal point.
760986606769766400,2016-08-03 23:52:00,Clinton/Democrats have been laser-focused on these attributes since Day of the DNC. It seems to be working.
760969494630133760,2016-08-03 22:44:00,Our forward-looking models have Clinton's Election Day win probability at around %. They want a bit more proof she can sustain her bounce.
760968737004654592,2016-08-03 22:40:59,"p.s. If you're going to look at the now-cast, probably better to look at how much a candidate is leading by than her probability of winning."
760968338017226752,2016-08-03 22:39:24,Our now-cast thinks Clinton would win by about % if you held the election right now.

760212446573367296,2016-08-01 20:35:45,All pretty normal. The conventional wisdom has been pretty good about anticipating polling shifts in the general (not so in the primaries).
760211649177550848,2016-08-01 20:32:35,"What's seemed to move the polls? - Trump and Clinton clinching respective nominations - Comey/FBI/email - DNC, and to a lesser extent RNC"
760210156143669249,2016-08-01 20:26:39,Clinton's large-ish bounce doesn't mean she's sure to win on Nov. . But it does suggest that political gravity still applies.
760140049946120192,2016-08-01 15:48:05,"So far, Clinton's bounce is bigger than Trump's:"
760070628959330304,2016-08-01 11:12:14,"...and possibly also made up some of the ground she lost in July. Question is, can she sustain this for a few weeks? Or is it temporary?"
760070019233353729,2016-08-01 11:09:48,"In all polls so far, Clinton's improved relative to the pre-convention version of the polls. IOW, she's gotten a larger bump than Trump..."

759748572845895680,2016-07-31 13:52:29,Interesting how we've shifted between high tide for Trump (where he's almost tied with Clinton) and low tide (down -10%) several times now.
759465439676272640,2016-07-30 19:07:25,"Entirely possible that Clinton got a big bounce, but we need more than one poll to confirm it. Lots of polls coming Sun/Mon/Tue I'd imagine."

758649266009214977,2016-07-28 13:04:14,"Short answer: model is more aggressive than some others at detecting trends, and there's been a big trend to Trump in polls this month."

758351392356564995,2016-07-27 17:20:36,"With that said, Trump's convention bounce is meh by historical standards. Seems larger because he was gaining on Clinton before conventions."
758349979475927041,2016-07-27 17:14:59,Lesson seems to be that you can get a convention bounce even with a mediocre convention.
758341745096679424,2016-07-27 16:42:15,I seriously wonder if Trump's going especially nuts because the DNC is getting better TV ratings than the RNC.
