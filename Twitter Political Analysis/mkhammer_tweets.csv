845406177546653701,2017-03-24 22:45:14,This is a good round-up of lots of polling from back then:
845405220200988677,2017-03-24 22:41:26,I'm not eligible for Medicare (just a few yrs!) or Medicaid. There's a giant middle where people like me are stuck.
845404529524965376,2017-03-24 22:38:41,"Yes, this is what many have now."
845404456720236546,2017-03-24 22:38:23,"No, that's the point. Ocare does not allow for anything affordable or decent for me. Just crap catastrophic plan w giant price tag."

845401708834541568,2017-03-24 22:27:28,"Right, the fact I'm in the Obamacre exchanges with a bunch of, um, regular Americans, is privilege in a nutshell."
845401195262939136,2017-03-24 22:25:26,Do I need to pull up the other proof from people who called me a liar for accurately predicting what would happen?
845401037313900544,2017-03-24 22:24:48,"Politifact Lie of the Year, . It's not perception."
845400792240664580,2017-03-24 22:23:50,"Why would I be cynical? Maybe bc the last big change was sold on lies &amp; incompetently implemented? Also predicted the website meltdown, FYI."
845400413998370818,2017-03-24 22:22:20,It's not vitriol. It's the actual truth. I'm just using correct words for it.
845399922706956288,2017-03-24 22:20:23,Sorry I won't let you forget those betrayals are real &amp; that makes you feel icky. Cynical about whether much at all can be done to fix.
845399020948328449,2017-03-24 22:16:48,"Further, while all you apologists were repeating Obama's lies, I accurately predicted what wld happen to indiv market, called a liar for it."
845398589408993281,2017-03-24 22:15:05,I had individual market pre-Obamacare. Far better and more affordable.

845397555135598593,2017-03-24 22:10:58,This is deep.
845396841915203585,2017-03-24 22:08:08,People not in Obamacare system have no idea what deductibles look like. $3K WOULD BE A GIFT.
845396198089523200,2017-03-24 22:05:34,"Hahaha, I LAUGH at a $3K deductible."
845394251743707137,2017-03-24 21:57:50,It's not deflection. It's the central point. Rs were taking fire for conceding things would change under this bill. Ds just lied.

837002467078438912,2017-03-01 18:11:53,I addressed it bc it was coming from people I respect who I thought could use perspective instead of infantilizing her.
837002185292533760,2017-03-01 18:10:46,"Actually, no. I elicitly addressed the more reasonable ""political eloitation"" argument, not crass personal attacks."
837001770463346692,2017-03-01 18:09:07,Taking time to think about her perspective &amp; not assume she's so hampered by sad ladybrains she can't make decisions = disgusting?
837001008664444928,2017-03-01 18:06:05,Glad to chat!
837000469130199054,2017-03-01 18:03:57,Maybe I have some perspective you don't.
837000313018138625,2017-03-01 18:03:19,Which is why I didn't say anyone was attcking her. They are infantilizing her.
837000115122552832,2017-03-01 18:02:32,"Her motivations are being entirely *discounted.* At the very least, you can consider both instead of infantilizing her."

836969772793331712,2017-03-01 16:01:58,"Then make that point without the ""poor dumb widow doesn't know what's going on"" messaging. Many weren't making a distinction."
836958836628066304,2017-03-01 15:18:31,"No one said it was the *point*, although now that I mention it, it's a far more noble point than SOTU laundry lists of nonsense."

836950613997023233,2017-03-01 14:45:50,Thanks for your nice reply. I RTed the original tweet w my response just now bc others were asking about this same thing.

836844068265148417,2017-03-01 07:42:28,Perhaps. I also know a bit about it.

836840056023367681,2017-03-01 07:26:31,"Sure, examine it without saying ""that dumb widow didn't know what was going on."" It's pretty simple."
836839441394204672,2017-03-01 07:24:05,"I daresay she has even more right to be upset than you or I, so maybe let her deal with it as she sees fit."

836834918940434432,2017-03-01 07:06:06,I learned to thread my tweets for this moment.

836830429105819650,2017-03-01 06:48:16,Maybe all that is more important than your angst about which president is involved &amp; how. Just bc she's crying doesn't mean she's a victim.
836828589249150976,2017-03-01 06:40:57,Maybe she thinks it might teach her children the strength &amp; courage of their dad (&amp; mom!) to watch her stand up tall even when it hurts.
836828001006456832,2017-03-01 06:38:37,Maybe she knows one day she will show them this video &amp; tell them the President of the United States &amp; all the nation honored him.
836827619505098757,2017-03-01 06:37:06,"Maybe a widow raising children knows how important it is to keep his name &amp; memory alive, &amp; that this moment is bigger than Trump or you."

836821911107747840,2017-03-01 06:14:25,Didn't say it was the motivation. But it is the result bc people have been so relentless in their outrage.
